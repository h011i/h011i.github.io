    <h1>All about my Guinea Pigs</h1> 

    <img src="images/guinea-pigs.jpg" />
    
    <p>
        I have two lovely and amazing Guinea Pigs.One is called Fudge and one is
        called Marshmallow.There two fluffy little piggies.
        There hobies are well absouletly nothing really all they do is sleep,run
        around,eat, drink and play haha. One piggie (Fudge) is a very confident,brave 
        boy but however Marshmallow is the complete opposite. Marshmallow is a shy scared 
        and not so confident piggie but that dosen't matter because I still love him 
        just how he is. 
        One thing they absouletly love is there vegtables/treats that is for them anyway 
        is lettuce and cucumber. I have tried them with other things like strawberries and
        banana but they dont seem to like it.

        They love spending time with me just as much as I love spending time with them. 
        Everytime I open up there cage Fudge always sprints towards me and gives me a bunch of
        kisses and nibbles.He absouletly adores his lovely scratches and strokes from me. 
        Everytime I go to scratch him on a certain spot which is his back he just can't resist 
        it he just plonks himself down and enjoys the scratches.
