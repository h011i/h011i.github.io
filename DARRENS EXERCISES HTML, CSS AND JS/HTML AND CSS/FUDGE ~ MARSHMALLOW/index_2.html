   <p> I have two lovely and amazing Guinea Pigs.One is called Fudge and one is called Marshmallow.There two fluffy little piggies.
    There hobies are well absouletly nothing really all they do is sleep,run around,eat, drink and play haha.
    One piggie (Fudge) is a very confident,brave boy but however Marshmallow is the complete opposite. Marshmallow is a shy scared and not so confident piggie but that dosen't matter because I still love him just how he is. 
    One thing they absouletly love is there vegtables/treats that is for them anyway is lettuce and cucumber. I have tried them with other things like strawberries and banana but they dont seem to like it.</p>

    <p>They love spending time with me just as much as I love spending time with them. Everytime I open up there cage Fudge always sprints towards me and gives me a bunch of kisses and nibbles.He absouletly adores his lovely scratches and strokes from me. Everytime I go to scratch him on a certain spot which is his back he just can't resist it he just plonks himself down and enjoys the scratches.</p>

    <u><p><h1> Guinea Pigs do a lot of things like...</h1> </u>
       <p>1) Sprawling 2)Wheeking 3)Chutting 4)Purring 5)Popcorning 6)Licking</p>
       
       <p>(These are some good ones)</p>
 
       (what they mean)
       <p>1. Sprawling is when they lay down on there side/tummy and when they do that it tells you that they feel comfortable and that they feel safe around you.</p>
        <p> </p>2. Wheeking is when they're Excited to see you or when they can see that you're holding food.</p>
       <p>3. Licking/nibbleing means they're licking your or nibbleing you to show there love and affection in other words grooming you. They're telling you that they care about your well-being. They also might lick you because you tase very tasty haha.</p>
       <p>4. Popcorning means when they're very very happy/excited/having a really good time and jumping for joy:)</p> 
        
        <p>(And these are some not so good ones)</p>
        <p>1. Chutting means that they could be angry,unhappy,or agitated at a certain situation.</p>
        <p>2. Purring can either mean both things one is they could either be happy or angry you just have to read the signs there facial expressions.</p>
